# Regulation SHO
The [[Regulation SHO]] was supposed to end wholesale fails-to-deliver, but is considered to be inadequate and unenforced.


## Inadequacies
Enough fails-to-deliver of a stock should put that stock on the SHO list, which should increase the enforcement of buy-ins and disclosed shorting.

A major (intentional?) loophole in Reg SHO is [[The Grandfather Clause]]. 
Another loophole is [[The Options Maker Exemption]].

## Consequences
When a [[Short Selling#Failure to Deliver|fail-to-deliver]] occurs, the fraudulent naked share is transacted as if it were real.
