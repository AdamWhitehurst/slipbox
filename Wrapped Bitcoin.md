# Wrapped Bitcoin
Also called WBTC; an [[ERC-20 Token]] that allows [[Bitcoin]] to be traded on the Etherium Blockchain. It is backed on a 1:1 ratio with BTC.

The main use case for WBTC is [[Decentralized Finance]].

When BTC is wrapped, the underlying BTC is held in a reserve by the BitGo Trust. For the sake of transparency, the amount of WBTC in circulation is [public](https://wbtc.network/dashboard/order-book), [with proof that the Bitcoin is being securely held in custody](https://wbtc.network/dashboard/order-book).
