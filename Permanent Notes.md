# Permanent Notes
Only permanent notes are kept in the [[Zettelkasten]]. [[Fleeting Notes]] or [[Literature Notes]] can become permanent notes if they contribute to the ongoing conversation of ideas happening in the Zettelkasten. Think:
- Serendipitous connections form from connections.
- What does this idea connect to? 
- Does it support an existing idea? 
- Does it contradict another? 

All literature notes, whether they were turned into permanent notes or not, go into your reference system.

Permanent notes should be written to have the potential to become part of or inspire a final written piece.
