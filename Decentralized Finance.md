# Decentralized Finance
Also called DeFi; the ecosystem of financial applications being built with blockchain technology. It was born in an August 2018 Telegram chat between Ethereum developers and entrepreneurs including Inje Yeo of Set Protocol, Blake Henderson of 0x and Brendan Forster of Dharma.

## Tenants
#### Non-Custodial
People control their own assets and data. Those assets and data can be transferred between people without the need for intermediaries.

#### Open
Everyone has access. There are no geopolitical borders. Called the "internet of value" because value is being transferred globally and seamlessly, like information on the internet.

#### Transparent
The code for these financial applications is open for anyone to inspect. Anyone is able to verify how applications and protocols are implemented. The transfer of value can be tracked.

#### Composable
Open-Source code allows developers to build upon others, accelerating innovation by allowing applications to be used like lego pieces i.e. Money Lego's. 

#### Decentralized
Build upon blockchains like [[Ethereum]]. Blockchains are composed of nodes spread across the world, providing the "decentralization" in DeFi.

## Open Finance
Since it is hard to meet the "Decentralized" tenant of DeFi while applications are still in heavy development, the main tenant that most application strive for is: Open access for anyone. All users are required to have is an internet connection and a blockchain address.
