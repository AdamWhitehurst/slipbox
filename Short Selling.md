# Short Selling
Investment or trading strategy that speculaters on the decline of a [[Security|security]]'s price.

A short selling position is opened by borrowing shares of a security (from a lender) that the investor believes will decrease in value. The investor then sells those borrowed shares at market price. The investor is betting that the price of the security will decrease, because when the investor buys back the borrowed shares, they will be able to profit from the difference in the original price and the later price. 

During the time that the shares are borrowed by the investor, the investor is expected to pay interest to the lender based on the market price of the security.

## Fail-to-Deliver
[[Market Makers]] have special exemptions from the buy-in rules: they are allowed to carry a naked short for up to twenty-one trading days before they have to buy-in. If the buy-in does not occur in the allotted time, the naked short becomes a "fail-to-deliver" of the borrowed share.

Aggregate fails–to–deliver are the only indices of counterfeit shares that the DTC and the prime brokers report to the SEC.

#### GameStop FtD's
In January 2021, GME had 1,787,191 fails-to-deliver since December.

Fails-to-deliver indicate fraudulent short transactions and since it's well-known that the amount of recorded fails-to-deliver are actually a small fraction of the real amount. 

This implies that there's are more fraudulent short positions in GME than any  other single stock in history. By. A. Lot.
