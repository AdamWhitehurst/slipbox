# The Grandfather Clause
A major (intentional?) loophole in [[Regulation SHO]] which allow all pre-SHO naked shorting to be considered legitimate.  Only the [[DTC]] knows for certain how many short shares are perpetual [[Short Selling#Failure to Deliver|fails-to-deliver]]. 

In 1998, REFCO, a large short hedge fund, filed bankruptcy and was unable to meet margin calls on their naked short shares. Under this scenario, the broker dealers are the next line of financial responsibility. The number of shares that allegedly should have been bought in was 400,000,000, but that probably never happened. The DTC — owned by the broker dealers — just buried 400,000,000 counterfeit shares in their system, where they allegedly remain — grandfathered into “legitimacy” by the SEC
