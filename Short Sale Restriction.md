# Short Sale Restriction
**SSR restricts short sellers** from piling into a stock whose **shares have dropped by 10%**. Once triggered, it becomes impossible for you to short the stock.

**Also known as the "Uptick Rule"**, SSR is a process aimed at **limiting short selling** in the stock market. The goal is to prevent short sellers from pushing the shares of a company lower.

## Rules
1.  First, the rule is only **triggered** **once** the shares of a **company drops by 10%** within a day. The ten percent starts from the yesterdayâ€™s close.
2.  Second, the SSR **restriction remains for the remainder of the day**. In many cases, the rule can extend to the next day.
3.  Third, the **SSR** rule **applies** **to all companies** that are **listed** **in American exchanges** like the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Nasdaq.
4.  Finally, the rule is **enforced by brokers**. At DTTW, you will always see the SSR when it is triggered.
