# Counterfeiting Stocks
Counterfeiting stocks revolves around [[Short Selling]] and [[Market Manipulation]] of a [[Stock|stock's]] price. It is a collusive act performed by [[Hedge Funds]], [[Market Makers]], and the [[Depository Trust Clearing Corporation]] to separate [[Retail Investors]] from their money. It is estimated that trillions of dollars have been fraudulently taken from retail investors by these institutions through counterfeiting stocks.

The mechanics of counterfeiting stocks revolves around transaction verification, which is also a core feature of the [[Blockchain]] technology. Unsurprisingly, instituting blockchain technology would fix the problem of counterfeiting stocks, remove the ability for funds to steal from the stock market, and eliminate the need for corrupt middlemen like the DTC, Prime brokers, etc.

## Participants
There are two parties necessary involved in fraud of counterfeiting stocks:
1. Producers of the counterfeit shares
2. The shorters who actively tear down the company

It is easy to identify the counterfeiters. A number of lawsuits that involve naked shorting have named about ten of the prime brokers as defendants, including Goldman Sachs, Bear Stearns, Citigroup, Merrill Lynch; UBS; Morgan Stanley and others. The DTCC has also been named in a number of lawsuits that allege stock counterfeiting.

It is harder to track and identify the shorters since they usually hide their identities through their prime brokers and layers of offshore domiciled shell corporations.

## Consequences
The magnitude of the counterfeiting is hundreds of millions of shares every day, and it may be in the billions. The real answer is locked within the prime brokers and the DTC.

Targets of this manipulation are usually the stock of small start-up companies due to small market caps and high liquidity. Since small business brings the vast majority of innovative ideas, products, and jobs to the market, manipulation of these companies' stock prices seriously impedes those new ideas, products, and jobs from being created.

## Ex-Clearing
Trades that occur dealer-to-dealer and don't clear through the DTC. This makes naked shorts "invisible" to the system so they don't become [[Short Selling#Fail-to-Deliver|fails-to-deliver]]. The SEC does not examine ex-clearing transactions because they don't believe that Reg SHO applies to short shares held in ex-clearing.

When a stock is transacted, the broker is able to (fraudulently) mismark a trading ticker as being a long sale when it is actually a short sale (or vice versa). The position is usually reconciled when the short covers, and since ex-clearing is not examined, this usually goes unnoticed.

The SEC regularly (and automatically) grants extensions to settlements before naked shorts become fails-to-deliver. Since most shorts have multiple entities, block trades can be done broker-to-broker so that the transaction does not appear on the exchange. These trades reset the time clock for the naked position, thus avoiding the buy-in rules.

## One-Day Lending
Broker dealers do one–day lends, which enables a short to identify to the SEC the account that shares were borrowed from. As soon as the report is sent in, the shares are returned to the broker dealer to be loaned to the next short. This allows eight to ten shorts to borrow the same shares, resetting the SHO–fail–to–deliver clock each time, which makes all of the counterfeit shares look like legitimate shares. The broker dealers charge each short for the stock lend.
