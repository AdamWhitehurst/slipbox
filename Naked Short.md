# Naked Short
A license to create a counterfeit share. Effectively increase the amount of shares in the marketplace beyond the number issued by the company. Based upon today's market rules, not all counterfeit shares are illegal.

## Buy-in Rules
The process of creating shares via naked shorting creates an artificially inflated sell-side. Time limits are imposed that dictate how long the sold share can be naked. For stock market investors, that limit is 3 days. [[SEC]] rules dictate that if the [[Prime Broker|Broker Dealer]] has not located a share to borrow within that time, they are supposed to take cash in the short account and purchase a share at market price. This is called a "buy-in."
