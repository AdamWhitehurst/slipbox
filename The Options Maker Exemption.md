# The Options Maker Exemption
A [[Regulation SHO]] exemption which allows certain options contracts to serve as borrowed shares for short sales even though there is no company-issued share behind the options contract. Despite considerable pressure, the SEC has refused to close the Options Maker Exemption.

Three months prior to SHO, the aggregate fails–to–deliver on the NASDAQ and the NYSE averaged about 150 million shares a day. Three months after SHO it dropped by about 20 million, as counterfeit shares found new hiding places.
