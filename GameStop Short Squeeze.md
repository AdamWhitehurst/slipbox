From [Bloomberg News]([https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-31/the-reddit-army-bailout-desperate-companies-get-new-lifelines?srnd=premium&sref=lmaDXFyR](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-31/the-reddit-army-bailout-desperate-companies-get-new-lifelines?srnd=premium&sref=lmaDXFyR)):

_“American Airlines revealed plans on Friday to sell as much as $1.1 billion of stock through what is known as an at-the-market program, which allows companies to issue additional shares at market prices. The announcement came after their stock was up as much as 38% at its peak last week._

_Just a couple days earlier, AMC said it had raised more than $300 million through a similar program. Investment firm Silver Lake, one of the company’s main creditors, also seized on AMC’s surge to convert $600 million of bonds into equity, before selling the shares in the open market for a gain of over $100 million.”_
